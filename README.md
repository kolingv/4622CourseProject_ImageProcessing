## 4622CourseProject_ImageProcessing
- This is course project from ELEC4622-Multimedia Signal Processing (2016-s2). May need some configuration on your VS and not guarantee successfully compilable but a work reference for your work.

- There are three mini projects (or tasks) all coded in c/c++. If u r student from UNSW, u might get project descriptions. Requirement of the projects may change from year to year. 

- I'll simply just copy tasks for each project here and leave theory fot later, or if you urgently need the whole theories, just feel free to contact me. vincentfong2016@gmail.com

#Project1 - reduction and expansion:
1. Reducing the size of an image by a factor of 5/3 in each direction - i.e., zoom-out.
2. Increasing the size of an image by a factor of 5/3 in each direction - i.e., zoom-in.

#Project2 - texture
1. build up a texture estimation program step by step, using windowed
DFT's (optionally FFT's) and averaging.

#Project3 - morphological
1. convert grey-scale images into bi-level images, based on a user-dened threshold.
This generally produces an image which contains undesirable noise artefacts,
in the form of holes and unwanted speckle. You will then implement a mor-
phological opening filter and (for bonus marks) a morphological closing lter,
in order to experiment with their impact on the bi-level thresholded image.
